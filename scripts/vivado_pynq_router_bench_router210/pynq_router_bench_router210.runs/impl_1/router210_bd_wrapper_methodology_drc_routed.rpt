2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.145 ns between router210_bd_i/bench_axi_0/inst/u_bench/time_cond_reg[3][8]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and router210_bd_i/bench_axi_0/inst/u_bench/winner_onehot_latched_reg[2]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.150 ns between router210_bd_i/bench_axi_0/inst/u_bench/time_cond_reg[3][8]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and router210_bd_i/bench_axi_0/inst/u_bench/winner_onehot_latched_reg[4]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.162 ns between router210_bd_i/bench_axi_0/inst/u_bench/time_cond_reg[3][8]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and router210_bd_i/bench_axi_0/inst/u_bench/winner_code_reg[1]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.197 ns between router210_bd_i/bench_axi_0/inst/u_bench/time_cond_reg[3][8]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and router210_bd_i/bench_axi_0/inst/u_bench/winner_onehot_latched_reg[1]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#5 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.199 ns between router210_bd_i/bench_axi_0/inst/u_bench/time_cond_reg[3][8]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and router210_bd_i/bench_axi_0/inst/u_bench/winner_onehot_latched_reg[3]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#6 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.211 ns between router210_bd_i/bench_axi_0/inst/u_bench/time_cond_reg[3][8]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and router210_bd_i/bench_axi_0/inst/u_bench/winner_code_reg[0]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led[0] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led[1] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led[2] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led[3] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on led[4] relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>
